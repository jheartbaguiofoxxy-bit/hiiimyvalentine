  <br> 
Hapit na ta mag one-year, hon, and during those months---I can see how you really want  to keep loving me, learning me, and being patient with me and most of all, learned to love himself in the process. I don't know how long mulast na always excited ikaw for me to make your day brighter and worth looking forward to and mine as well---I trust you, hon ko, for what you've said nga excited ikaw makakita nako...seeing you being all excited and happy to see me makes me feel very loved 🥹🫂 Kay I think whenever you dedicate your time just to talk to me,  spend time nako, and make silly moments always finds a way to make my calming heart beat jud🥹💕🌟💓🫂 Pero don't forget sa imong priorities lovey ha 🥹🫂💕💕💕 bsan gani kanang pagkacompetetive nimo, hon, maturn-on po ako hehe 🥹😭 mostly turn-on nga kanang good, loving, seen way ha...yk  about the other side hwahwahwh🫣 pero later rana didto sa dedicated page niya hahaha

 I LOVE MY BABU WHEN HE SURPRISES ME🥹😭😭🫂💕🌹💋🫂 bsan random dad jokes ra, akong heart mafill ghapon ug love, joy, hope (yis, Cardo Dalisay/j) I feel very loved when my babu makes me comfortable around him🥹 telling me na, "it's okay," I'll take care of it," "just be a cutie/pakyot ra dra" 😭 tapos magsearch pa sa google on how to do stuffs for me🥹(like massaging my feet/cook/anything nga I can feel love🥹) tapos treats me whenever naay moolah 🥹🥹 Thankuu always sa efforts, honey ko🥹🫂💋🌹💕💓💓 ✨ I LOVE YOUU SO SO SO MUCHOO ALWAYS AND ALWAYS, HON KOO 🥹🫂🌹💕💓✨🌟
<br>
<br>

To be deeply honest jud, hon, loving you was hard---because at first, gastruggle pa ako na muadjust sa katong mga behaviors nimo na wa jud nako naganahi. I have to teach you what was good or bad, I had to give you options and sometimes I have no other choice but irule over akong toxic traits when naay behaviors nga d nako ganahan nga pwede man icommunicate. As  time passes by, while you learned the rough terrains of loving me, I also learned the same path as you. All those silent treatments, hurtful words, not addressing immediately, anything that doesn't sit right with you, I slowly peeled it away from me. Maybe gamay sa jealousy kay ahhmm ahah d jd nako siya malikayan chat hdagdddbad😭😭🏃🏃All those risky mannerisms, sarcastic tones during fighting, offensive demeanors, anything that is not my cup of tea, you learned to leave it in the past. What I really love about us is that we learned that communication is everything , well, we almost gave up, but we tried again---trying shows we care and I really love those kinds of moments.
<Br> 
<br> 
Then, when we got comfortable with each other na, I learned that you were not hard to love. You were someone worth learning for. I don't hate to admit that I am stubborn, I want to go my own ways, luoran. I realized, truthfully, going through these personalities shapes me to love you. When I mentioned I'm not loving you the way you wanted but then when that time comes, I barely appear, you'd feel invisible. I'M REALLY SORRY BABU IF I DIDN'T GIVE YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO FEEL LOVED 🥹😭😭  I've been trying and I always hope you've seen my trials. It makes me happy when I give you what you need to be loved. Writing this, I realized this is how you would feel whenever I'm satisfied with what you give. How a simple answer could make your day and reassured that I am loved. I'm crying writing tis chat because how can a precious man just trying to give his very best not praised by his woman---I'm crying rn because how ungrateful I am when I am so lucky to have you, asawa ko 🥹😭 I will definitely never forget how hurt you felt when I asked for more, when I indirectly told you, "your efforts were not enough" and saying I love you was forced 🥹😭 I promise babu, I'm really grateful for everything you did for me po 🥹😭 and even if you say to not mind it because you already forgave me, I will still never ever forget it po🥹😭
<Br>
  <br> 
Throughout the months I am really grateful that babu learned I'm into real flowers, handmade items filled with love, reassurance, being chosen, and loves fries crispier on the outside and soft inside 🥹😭🫂💕✨♥️🌹🌹 and with those accompanying months, I learned babu wants to be held, reassured, trying different things, lowering pride when neeeded, reciprocating his acts of service, and loving him with whimsy 🥹🫂💕✨🌹🫀
<Br>
<br> 
          and just in case you forgot, mahal, I'm always here okay? 🥹telle anything. Tell me without saying, "you're using it against me" because you have every right and time to tell me anything, any reason. Just, anything that makes your heart know that I'm a safe space, I'm not a threat, hon🥹 and I don't have the intention of punishing you po🥹🥹 because we just have to stay present, dba? 🥹💕 be here with the present and me, babu🥹🌹⭐💋💕 sobra sobrang mahal po kita, babi🥹 and ify comfort/response doesn't satisfy you, tell me.🥹🥹 just a simple tell me, babu🥹💕💕 You're the only one I could think of, hon🥹💓 I am happy with my babu🥹 like very very happy po🥹💓💓💕💕💋⭐🌹🌹🌹
<Br>
<br> 
          I want to spend more Valentine's day with you po, honey 🥹🫂💕✨🌹🫀I want to surprise each other with gifts, greet happy heart's day to each other, and make more love 🥹🥹🫂💕💕🌹🌹💋I LOVE YOUU SO SO SO MUCHH, HON KO!! 🥹🫂🌹🌹🌹
