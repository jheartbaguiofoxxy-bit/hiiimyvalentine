        <p style="color:#fa8072;font-size: 12px;"> Hii po honey! Happy Valentine's day po, mi amor 🌹♥️  I'm happy to celebrate this year's heart day with you po, hon!!🌹🌹🌹 This marks a introduction for this letter I made for you and I hope you like it hehe♥️ Sit bacc/lay down and relax while reading and experiencing this valentine website I made for you po!</p>
        <br>
        <p style="color:#fa8072;font-size: 12px;"> First, I am really happy that I will spend this valentines day with YOUU po (yes, my idol since ato pajd JHS! Ikaw man diy ni, boss master tung naggama ug dragon2 HAHAHAH I LOVE  YOUUU POO FROM THE CROWD), like super very very happy jud! I just got lost nga lang sa time and date,  thus,  nagclutch siya rn LOL...BUT! Even if giclutch, I still want to take my time and deliver a gift for this special day. </p>
        <br>
        <p style="color:#fa8072;font-size: 12px;"> Feb. 10 pajd ko gahuna2 what to give for babu, I even thought of gastoing (maghimog DIY stuffs and other things) para sa gift but I was undecided (and walay time makapalit kay gaapas sa bus) at that moment kay I'm already having a financial crisis. Along the way, my mind was literally absent from everything plus pajud atung gaaway ta days ago so bsag gaduty, para bang occupied sa kablank akong mind kay d na kaaapas sa date haha. Last night, I planned to make a gift, but yk what happened ...so I went to distract myself on the internet hahaha. Ever since my babu comforted me, reassured me, and I was able to express my thoughts, I feel happy and loved nga I'm understood and gave me advices pa to cope with things in a better way---at that point my mind was free. I'm thankful, hon ko🥹🥹 I was expecting na masuko ikaw nako kay I had  lot of days to think about it and make one but I didn't do anything---when you asked me who's going to start first (of giving lovely gifts), I literally feel like nothing because I have none on my hands other than giving problems this week. Then, you told me I still have time to make for tomorrow and having me is already enough as a gift, it was very sweet of you po, hon ko 🥹😭😭😭😭🌹🌹🌹 So uhm, I fell in love even more kay I feel loved from babu po and that should always be a reminder for me to be grateful that I have someone very loving, caring, sweet, and so on so forth 🥹😭 </p>

<p style="color:#fa8072;font-size: 12px;"> I woke up and decided to choose suffering coated with love hehe. I asked myself, "what other things can I give to him aside from drawings, letters, DIY gifts that he haven't received yet?" Then I remembered, "oh shi I can code" LMFAO and I'M VERY EXCITED TO MAKE IT JUD 🥹😭 It's been like a year since I've coded and some info...well, it got washed away to  distant lands lol. I'm happy that I'm making one for my loved one, which is my babu! I learned again what needs to be learned and not only  was it remembered but also added and here I am presenting to you my new learnings (although, dli lang siya visible kay naa mn sa code and iyaha rang gitranslate sa website ang nais itranslate---wao nagtatagalog yan sha) hehehe. Just a warning tho (if warning bajd ni siya) kay I feel wa ni siyay na include na drawing considering galearn ko balik+limitedd kaayong time huhu but! You'll see the recent ones! sssssoooo aahhm actually nastressed ko gamay while gahimo ani 😐 but stress nga kanang makalipay once masolve na ang problema hahaha. ENEWIZZ you have different choices kung asa ikaw una muread hehe. So pagusto ikaw unsay una nimo basahun, hon ko hehee</p>
